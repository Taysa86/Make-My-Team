# Make-My-Team

# Description
This project was created as a database to add and store information on memebers of a department. It includes catagories for managers, engineers, employees, and interns. It is currently still in development.

# Usage
This project is currently in development, but will be used by running node.js in your terminal.
# Credits
I must give credit to my TA's as I struggle with turning in projects that are not up to my standard, and they have encouraged me to just get it turned in after falling behind due to health issues.
